-- The 'MaybeT' monad transformer extends a monad with the ability to exit
-- the computation without returning a value.
--
-- A sequence of actions produces a value only if all the actions in
-- the sequence do.  If one exits, the rest of the sequence is skipped
-- and the composite action exits.
--
-- For a variant allowing a range of exception values, see
-- "Control.Monad.Trans.Except".
